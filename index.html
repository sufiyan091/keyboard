   <center> <h1 class="two">21 Weird & Fun Facts
        About Computer Keyboards You Didn't Know About</h1></center>
    <ol>

        <li>The Canadian "snow mode" key</li>
        <p style="font-size: 15px; padding-left: 22px; ">The french canadian keyboard layout is used in french-speaking
            parts of Canada, mainly the Quebec region. It features the "snow mode" key, with snowflake icon next to Ctrl
            caption. It looks funny, because we usually tend to associate Canada with winter time (although it's the
            same stereotype that all Italians eat pasta only). The truth is, the icon graphically represent the Ctrl
            (Control) key and nothing more. It was established by ACNOR in the first canadian keyboard layout, which was
            later copied by computer manufacturers, including Apple for its French Canadian layout.</p>
        <li> The shortest space keys are found in... Japan </li>
        <p style="font-size: 15px; padding-left: 22px; ">Space is the longest key on every keyboard, but in Japan the
            statistical Spacebar is much shorter than in any other place on Earth. Why? Because japanese keyboards
            require switching between latin/roman letters (called rōmaji) and japanese characters (called hiragana and
            kana). To do that switching, additional keys are required. They are placed next to Space. In the result,
            japanese keyboards look like this:</p>
        <li> When you hit spacebar, 600000 people in the world did just the same </li>
        <p style="font-size: 15px; padding-left: 22px; ">Talking about the space, it's not only the longest key, but
            also the most used one. Without the space, it would be hardtoreadthisarticle, don't you think? According to
            this YouTube video by Vsauce, when you type, 18% of all keyboard hits goes to spacebar. You also don't type
            alone, ever. From doing math, it turns out that in every 1/10th of a second on Earth, spacebar is hit
            600,000 times. So when you hit the space, you're doing it at the exact time as 600,000 other people. Wow :)
        </p>
        <li> QWERTY is not the most efficient keyboard layout </li>
        <p style="font-size: 15px; padding-left: 22px; ">We tend to think that QWERTY keyboard layout is the most
            efficient because it's so widespreadly used. Nothing can be more wrong. So why keyboard starts with QWERTY
            and not, for example, ABCDE? QWERTY layout was invented by Christopher Sholes in 1872 for his new typewriter
            design (of course there was no computers these days). It turns out that when you would place keys in
            alphabetical order, people would type so fast, that the mechanical parts (so called hammers) would jam.
            Sholes came with the idea that in order to slow people down, you need to mess with the layout. QWERTY is
            also constructed that way to minimize the neighbouring keystrokes - which too - jammed the hammers. As the
            computers took place of typewriters, the QWERTY was already a legacy that was uncritically adopted</p>
        <li> Mini-keyboards </li>
        <p style="font-size: 15px; padding-left: 22px; ">These keyboards use only few keys to type full range of
            possible characters. But how is that possible? Instead of typing one character with one key (like on the
            normal keyboard), in chorded keyboard you're using chords (like on the piano). This way you can type much
            more characters than there's physical keys. Chorded keyboards are used mainly by visually impaired (Braille
            versions) and in situations where normal keyboard is useless.</p>
        <li>Dirty keyboards</li>
        <p style="font-size: 15px; padding-left: 22px; ">Do you know that your keyboard may contain more germs than
            toilet seat? A study conducted by UK scientists found out that four out of 33 keyboards tested were
            potential health hazards, and one had levels of germs five times higher than that found on the toilet seat.
            Some keyboards in office buildings even had mice droppings in them! How to prevent this situation? Wash your
            hands and clean keyboard the right way.</p>
        <li>Keyboard from space</li>
        <p style="font-size: 15px; padding-left: 22px; "> There are four keys on majority of modern keyboards that are
            legacy from the ancient times of computers. Here we'll focus on three of them:
            System Request is often abbreviated SysRq or Sys Req. The origin of this key dates back to 1980, when IBM
            computers typically ran few operating systems. System Request was designed to switch between them. Since
            then, the key has no purpose. Today it is rarely used in software testing and programming on Windows system.
            Print Screen (usually placed in conjunction with System Request), often abbreviated PrtScr or PrntScrn. It's
            original purpose was to capture the screen and print it on paper. Today it's used to capture the screen and
            save it to clipboard.
            Pause/Break key have it's predecessor in 19th century telegraph, where electrical circuit had to break in
            certain moment. Today, the key has no real meaning and it's used in keyboard shortcuts and few games. Pause
            functionality works in terminal environments to pause the execution of command or program, but is rarely
            used almost exclusively by programmers.</p>

        <p style="font-size: 15px; padding-left: 22px; ">Many people and businesses communicate in two or more languages. Translators need bilingual keyboards to
            easily type in one of selected keyboard layout. People who have families in two different countries often
            need bilingual keyboards to write emails or chat on Facebook in two languages. Businesses (especially in
            customer service departments) must communicate with customers who speak foreign languages.

            All those people need special keyboards. Of course keyboards are simply produced this way, many layouts are
            bilingual by default (eg. korean, arabic, japanese), but still, the possibilities are limited and the cost
            is higher than normal keyboard. That's why people use bilingual stickers for keyboards, which simply expand
            the functionality for a reasonable price. Plus, you can change them over time to something different.</p>
        <li>Keys that are (rather) useless but still on keyboards today</li>
        <p style="font-size: 15px; padding-left: 22px; ">There is an ongoing trend for the last couple of years, especially among young people, to decorate their
            laptop keyboards (and whole laptops) with vinyl stickers. These stickers are subject to fashion, have
            trending colors or patterns, like Stardust or Washi tape. There are few global brands that specializes in
            such products, among them Keyshorts, of which I am the co-founder. You can see some of the MacBook keyboard
            decals on our website.</p>
        <li>Bilingual keyboards</li>
        <p style="font-size: 15px; padding-left: 22px; ">Many people and businesses communicate in two or more languages. Translators need bilingual keyboards to
            easily type in one of selected keyboard layout. People who have families in two different countries often
            need bilingual keyboards to write emails or chat on Facebook in two languages. Businesses (especially in
            customer service departments) must communicate with customers who speak foreign languages.

        <li>The mysterious Scroll Lock</li>
        <p style="font-size: 15px; padding-left: 22px; ">Scroll Lock (abbreviated ScrLk) is the fourth of rather useless keys on modern keyboards, but it deserves
            it's own place on the list. Why? Because it never really had any particular function (!). It supposed to
            lock page scrolling with arrow keys, but since its introduction it never worked that way. Today it is very
            rarely used, mainly as a part of keyboard shortcuts. </p>
        <li>The father of all modern keyboards</li>
        <p style="font-size: 15px; padding-left: 22px; ">The model M, produced by IBM and Lexmark starting in 1984, is the father of modern day keyboard. It
            introduced separated numeric section, separated arrow keys, and the separate row of function keys. It is
            considered the most universal computer keyboard design and is still in use today.</p>
        <li>Editing keyboards</li>
        <p style="font-size: 15px; padding-left: 22px; ">There are special keyboards for professional use in movie studios, design agencies and music studios. These
            are called editing keyboards. Keys in such keyboards contain additional information and icons which refer to
            app or environment the keyboard is used in. For example, there are keyboards for movie editing software,
            such as Final Cut Pro or Adobe Premiere Pro. Cheaper and more versatile option is keyboard stickers for
            apps, which are installed on regular keyboards.</p>
        <li>Dvorak keyboard layout</li>
        <p style="font-size: 15px; padding-left: 22px; ">The first man to question the QWERTY layout was August Dvorak, who created and patented his layout in 1936.
            Dvorak layout allegedly incorporate less finger movement which lead to faster typing speed and reduced
            repetitive strain injuries. There is an ongoing debate whether these claims are true or not. While Dvorak
            layout is still a niche, most of operating systems (including Windows, Mac OS X and Linux) give user the
            ability to change keyboard layout to Dvorak. Some keyboard decals we talked about earlier can be designed in
            Dvorak layout. Today, Dvorak is used mainly by geeks, programmers, and typists.</p>
        <li>Keyboard computers</li>
        <p style="font-size: 15px; padding-left: 22px; ">You don't see them now, but in the 80's and early 90's keyboard computers (computers that fit inside bulky
            keyboard) was common in people's homes. Commodore 64 and Amiga 500 was notable examples, although they were
            popular mostly in Europe. In the mid 90's they were dethroned by the PCs.</p>
        <li>The fastest typist on Earth</li>
        <p style="font-size: 15px; padding-left: 22px; ">Is statistically a woman (typist was and is a strongly feminine occupation). Currently, the official world
            record is held by Barbara Blackburn (typing in english). Unofficially, Sean Wrona set the world record for
            typing over a minute and 50 minutes intervals. You can see him typing for the record on YouTube. There is an
            ongoing debate as to how to measure typing speed, because it depends on language, keyboard layout and the
            keyboard itself. Many of the fastest typist on earth use Dvorak layout.</p>
        <li>Gaming keyboards</li>
        <p  class="three" style="font-size: 15px; padding-left: 22px;;">Another type of ergonomic keyboards are these used by gamers. They can feature additional keys and gizmos
            that relate to particular game or common games activities.</p>
        <li>CTRL ALT DEL</li>
        <p style="font-size: 15px; padding-left: 22px; ">Is a famous keyboard shortcut to soft reboot or bring a Close Program dialog on Windows. The idea for soft
            rebooting via keyboard came from David Bradley (IBM). This shortcut was chosen for safety reasons, to avoid
            accidental trigger. Ctrl Alt Del was chosen because it was impossible to hold this combination with one hand
            on the IBM PC 5150 keyboard.</p>
        <li> More than one national layout</li>
        <p style="font-size: 15px; padding-left: 22px; ">Many countries have more than one national keyboard layout. In most of these countries one layout is
            overwhelmingly more common than the other (Turkey, Poland). In other countries, there are few equivalent
            layouts: in South Korea there are few Hangul layouts. Chinese use Traditional, Simplified, Cantonese and
            Taiwanese variants. India has one layout (called InScript) for all its official languages: hindi, bengali,
            gujarati, gurmukhi, kannada, malayalam, oriya, tamil and telugu.</p>
        <li>The longest words to type with one hand</li>
        <p style="font-size: 15px; padding-left: 22px; ">On QWERTY keyboard, these are stewardesses (among other 12-letter words) for left hand, and polyphony for the
            right hand. According to this research, Dvorak layout can produce 14-letter words with only left hand used,
            for example overemphasized.</p>
        <li>All hail the QWERTY</li>
        <p style="font-size: 15px; padding-left: 22px; ">First email ever sent contained the qwertyuiop, all letters from the top row of QWERTY keyboard. As Ryan
            Tomlinson (the man who did it) explained, he just needed something to put in the email to test if it's
            working.

            There is a planetoid called (6600) Qwerty, which was discovered in 1988.

            The qwerty is also one of the most commonly used passwords on earth. Don't use it.</p>
